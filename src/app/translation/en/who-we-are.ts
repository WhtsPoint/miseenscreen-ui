                        My career path as a manager has always developed
                        organically and productively. At 20, I became a deputy
                        director after two years of work as a sales consultant, and at
                        21, I became the director of the third store out of 150 in the
                        leading household appliance company in Ukraine -
                        "Foxtrot."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the age of 23, I was offered a position as a regional
                        manager of 15 stores in the same company, but I declined. I
                        declined due to burnout from working in a retail
                        environment. I am not afraid to use the word "burnout"
                        because it was the impetus for new and key moments in my
                        life. At that time, I was already interested in developing
                        other competencies. I wanted to try new roles in my career,
                        specifically working in HR and staff training. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After refusing the position of regional manager, I made the
                        decision to quit and look for work in a new field where my
                        managerial skills would also be useful. I sent all my resumes
                        for positions such as head of the training department or
                        HRD, although I had no experience in such positions. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Working as a store director with a team of 40 people, I
                        enjoyed the recruitment and training process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a director, I built and developed the training process in
                        my store. My trainings methods sparked interest in the head
                        office, and I participated in the development of various
                        training and adaptation programs. For me, training was a
                        process in which I could express my creative abilities, create,
                        present, and acquire new knowledge.

                        When I was involved in this, I
                        understood that this was one of the directions in which I was
                        interested in deepening, as it is a scenario where the activity
                        brings incredible satisfaction. And my skills in analysis and
                        working with results and indicators, according to the
                        principle of "measure actions with numbers," strengthened
                        my creative ambitions.

                        Creating and developing a training and recruiting system is
                        not just about the creativity that I love so much. First and
                        foremost, it is about working with business performance.

                        In my resume, I could demonstrate my experience in
                        working with indicators and developing training methods.
                        However, my applications for HRD positions, training
                        department manager, recruiter, or trainer turned out to be
                        unsuccessful. Companies offered me a position as a regional
                        retail manager, emphasizing that people with such results are 
                        needed in retail.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While sending out my resume once, I accidentally opened
                        multiple tabs with job vacancies. Due to this mistake, I sent
                        my resume to MNS Investment, the official representative of
                        the Italian brands Calzedonia, Intimissimi, Tezenis, and
                        Falconeri in Ukraine, and was invited for an interview. I
                        mistakenly applied for the position of a regional manager. In
                        my scenario, this randomness turned out to be a fateful
                        event, although I didn't know it at the time.

                        This company had a lot that was perfect for me - the type of
                        activity, specifically selling Italian lingerie, hosiery, and
                        knitwear, the working conditions, as well as the desired
                        location in the capital and a beautiful office. All these factors 
                        were important to me, especially considering that at the time. 
                        I was living in a small town near the capital.

                        But I was offered the position that I had applied for -

                        above, and I did not want to go back, as retail had already
                        been enough experience for me.

                    <p>
                        In the evening of the day of the first interview, I received a
                        call inviting me to the next stage with the CEO.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The power of interest and intuition drove me to go, and this
                        stage with the CEO was a great interview experience.
                        Intelligence and rationality, discussion of indicators and books read, competitor
                        marketing companies and analysis of sales by category. I was impressed, seeing
                        in the manager the qualities that are important to me - a business approach and
                        ease of communication. This leader was one of the owners, and I admit that after
                        talking to him, I became interested in working with a person with whom
                        communication impressed and stuck with me.

                        In the discussion of prospects, I heard that at the moment the
                        company is actively developing in the market and also plans
                        to create a training department in the future. This
                        information made me think that if I accept the job offer, then
                        in a year I will be able to develop this department. I agreed
                        to the position of regional manager in order to study the
                        company's processes and offer my candidacy for the
                        development of the training department.

                        After 8 months, I developed a project to confirm my candidacy for
                        the creation and development of the training department.

                    <p>
                        An important person in creating the project was my 14-year-old brother Volodymyr at
                        that time
                        who is now a partner and project
                        developer at MISEENSCREEN. I found out that he was
                        programming games and asked him to write a demo version
                        of a web application for training and corporate culture in the
                        company. We agreed that he would work on this project after
                        its approval.

                        I began to build a training department, write and conduct
                        training sessions, create educational materials for four and
                        then five different brands, develop a training system, create
                        tests, conduct certifications, and develop professional
                        development systems, ratings, and analytics. In addition, I
                        started building the recruiting process. All of this was also
                        aimed at developing corporate culture and creating a healthy
                        environment for the staff through support and interaction
                        with employees, taking into account generational differences
                        and the company's goals.

                        All of this was happening concurrently with the development
                        of a web application that encompassed the processes of all
                        employee life cycles within the company. The processes
                        evolved and were systematized, and the web platform was
                        developed with new features. One of the latest enhancements
                        to the portal was the Retail (ERP) option, the purpose of
                        which was to transfer all communication and interaction
                        processes, management, and processing of processes
                        between departments and company employees.

                        I absolutely loved what I was doing, and to this day, I love
                        and cherish that period. It was important and interesting for
                        me to be involved in everything within the company, and this
                        was reflected in the performance indicators within my area
                        of responsibility.

                    <p>
                        However, this was not forever. I felt it and periodically
                        repeated it to myself. This job was amazing, but it was not
                        eternal, like many things, maybe even everything in this
                        world. Being aware of this also increased the value of the
                        moment for me and urged me to hurry and do as much and
                        as good as possible in my work. Despite working as an
                        employee, I treated my work and web project as my own.

                        considered it an incredible opportunity in life. I dreamed of
                        the USA, wanted to get an American education and develop
                        in one of the leading countries in the world.

                        choice at that time. A choice between what I equally loved
                        and was interested in. On one hand, I had a beloved job with
                        clearer prospects, and on the other hand, there was America
                        and the opportunity to start an unknown and new path, which
                        was also interesting and desired. I won't go into detail about
                        my American dream, but I made the choice in its favor.

                        a solid use case. We completely revamped all the features,
                        added new options for the organization to minimize the need
                        for programmer support, and the company enjoyed the

                        If I love creating such projects, managing them, and helping businesses
                        through web applications so much, I can do it from
                        anywhere in the world through my own company.

                        MISEENSCREEN is passionate about technology and process
                        systematization. In our experience, a web portal developed
                        for the training department with electronic learning
                        systematization, analytics, and other processes has given me,
                        as a manager, time for the creative part - writing training
                        courses, communicating with colleagues through store visits,
                        conducting various training sessions, meetings, and events.

                        MISEENSCREEN believes that every person has the power and
                        abilities to develop in this world, and when there is a
                        resource where technology and artificial intelligence can
                        help solve a range of tasks, the person and the organization
                        gain even more valuable resource - time. How to use it is up
                        to the owner. And we will be happy to provide you with even more time to
                        develop yourself and your organization through our
                        developments!

                        In conclusion, MISEENSCREEN is a combination of many
                        circumstances, the key ones being the interest and desire to
                        work in the training department, being born into a family
                        where your brother is a talented developer, and working with
                        the CEO who may not have believed, but still supported the
                        passionate eyes and the demonstration version of creating
                        the training department.

                    <p>    
                        And, of course, following the path
                        of a dream and the desire to explore this world. If I hadn't
                        chosen a new path of development with moving to the USA,
                        we don't know what would have happened, but we do know
                        that this circumstance definitely accelerated the creation of
                        MISEENSCREEN.
