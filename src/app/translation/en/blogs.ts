And often it continues like this: \"I'm not a robot, I can make mistakes!\" And it's true - humans are capable of making mistakes, feeling, loving, getting upset. However, it's important to understand that all these feelings are a result of the evolution and nature of biological intelligence, and how this can impact the work and success of your organization is also an important and interesting question. In this article, you will learn about the systematic building of relationships between employees and the organization through support for employees and freedom of speech in the company, about creating unified rules of the game in conditions of efficiency and healthy relationships, and how digital technologies can help with this",

                <h2>To Be Alive — Or Just Efficient in the System?</h2>
                <p>
                    <i>“I’m not a robot!”</i> — how often have you heard someone
                    say this during a heated discussion or in defense of a
                    mistake? It’s often followed by: “I’m not a robot, I can
                    make mistakes!” And it’s true — being human means
                    being capable of error, of emotion, of love, frustration,
                    joy, and doubt.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These feelings are not flaws but features — natural
                    outcomes of biological evolution and human intelligence.
                    Still, when we step into the realm of business and
                    organizations, a complex question arises: <i>how do these
                    human traits affect efficiency, performance, and success?</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This topic lies at the core of a series of articles that
                    explore <i>how to build strong, systematic relationships
                    between employees and organizations</i>. The focus is on
                    fostering emotional well-being, ensuring freedom of
                    speech in the workplace, and setting clear, unified rules
                    that balance efficiency with empathy. It also examines
                    how digital tools and technologies can support these
                    goals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every living being operates based on patterns of behavior
                    influenced by biology and experience. Only digital
                    systems, artificial intelligence, and programmed robots
                    are truly consistent — incapable of deviating from their
                    instructions. And yet, the goal is not to turn people into
                    machines, but to <i>build systems where human nature is
                    acknowledged, respected, and supported — without
                    compromising organizational efficiency</i>.

                <h2>Can We Rewire Human Nature for Efficiency?</h2>
                <p>
                    Reflecting on my journey from a sales consultant to
                    Director of Human Resources and Training, I’ve seen
                    how organizations—often with the best intentions—
                    believe that by changing people, they can create an
                    environment that perfectly fits their operational needs.
                    But working to reshape human nature and biological
                    intelligence is a complex, costly, and often ineffective
                    endeavor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Reprogramming software to align with new goals is
                    faster, easier, and more natural than trying to reprogram
                    human beings. Most employees in your organization are
                    already mature individuals shaped by their unique life
                    paths—formed by experiences, family, society, and
                    evolution. They carry with them a rich inner world:
                    emotions, memory, reactions, and a distinct way of
                    perceiving reality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The more you understand human physiology and how
                    biological intelligence works, the less you’ll feel the need
                    to moralize or “correct” others. In my experience—and in
                    conversations with trainers, HR professionals, and
                    business owners—many of us have, at some point, turned
                    to best-selling business books and leadership seminars
                    hoping to find a blueprint for success. These materials are
                    often filled with universal advice, personal stories, and
                    ready-made cultural solutions, but rarely take into account
                    one key factor: the human being you’re trying to
                    influence.

                    Much of the content in this genre is shaped by the
                    author’s subjective experience and context, which may
                    not match the conditions of your business. That’s why,
                    instead of copying behavior or management models, it’s
                    far more productive to understand the physiological and
                    cognitive mechanisms behind human behavior. This
                    approach replaces guesswork and assumptions with
                    awareness: Why do people react the way they do? What
                    truly drives their behavior? And <i>what conditions must be
                    created for employees to accept and follow the
                    organization’s “rules of the game”</i>?
                </p>
                <p>
                    It’s neither good nor bad when an organization tries to
                    evolve using the tools available to it. With investments,
                    goals, and responsibilities at stake, leaders act in
                    accordance with their own philosophies—philosophies
                    they believe are effective. The key is not to eliminate
                    emotion entirely, but to create a system where human
                    reactions don’t derail performance.

                    If we cannot “reprogram” a person—then what can we
                    do? <i>We can design systems that respect human nature
                    while still guiding people toward structured, efficient
                    interaction.</i>

                <b>When Reality Becomes the Best Teacher</b>
                <p>
                    One insightful example of human behavior can be found
                    in the animated film Soul, through the character of 22. In
                    the story, 22 is a cynical, self-absorbed soul who refuses
                    to believe that life on Earth has any value. Not even the
                    world’s greatest minds—Mother Teresa, Abraham
                    Lincoln, or Gandhi—can convince her otherwise. No
                    amount of persuasion or inspiration seems to work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But something changes when 22 accidentally ends up on
                    Earth and begins to experience real life firsthand. Simple
                    moments—a leaf falling, a slice of pizza, the wind in the
                    trees—bring her joy. It is <i>not words or authority that
                    transform her, but direct experience</i>. This beautifully
                    illustrates an important point: <i>human behavior is not
                    always changed through logic or guidance—it often
                    changes through environment and emotional connection</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the context of organizations and business, this idea
                    holds true. Instead of trying to force change in people or
                    lecture them into compliance, a more sustainable strategy
                    is <i>to build systems that create an environment where
                    people naturally align with the company’s efficiency goals
                    —while still feeling emotionally safe and supported.</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    That’s why <i>we advocate for personalized, businessspecific strategies that take into account the unique
                    identity, structure, and values of each organization.</i>
                    Universal frameworks and methodologies can provide a
                    foundation, but true impact comes from adapting these
                    tools to reflect your company’s reality. After all, no one is
                    trying to invent a round or triangular television—we just
                    aim to improve the screen and the viewer’s experience.
                    Likewise, the question becomes: what kind of emotional
                    and operational response does your organizational
                    environment evoke in employees?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Importantly, this is not a call to discard traditional
                    methods like team-building sessions, motivational
                    speeches, or inspiring training programs. These tools
                    absolutely have their place. But think of them like special
                    effects in a film—they enhance the experience but are not
                    the main plot. Employees might enjoy a great lunch or an
                    inspiring talk, but if they return to chaotic, bureaucratic
                    processes or an emotionally draining office space lit by
                    harsh fluorescent lights, the motivation quickly fades.

                    In the previous article, we explored how implementing
                    digital platforms and tools can support both organizations
                    and their employees. As technology evolves, so do we—
                    moving from primitive environments to advanced systems
                    that shape the way we live and work today

                    <i>Company culture touches every part of the employee
                    experience</i> — from the type of chairs people sit on, to
                    systems of evaluation, training, compensation, and
                    communication. In this section, we will present practical
                    tools for improving internal communication and fostering
                    feedback within an organization.
                </p>
                <h2>Corporate Culture. Interaction.</h2>
                <p>
                    A transparent and supportive corporate culture can be
                    cultivated through several key strategies focused on
                    strengthening employee interaction: 
                </p>
                <h3>Employee Support: Feedback, Questions, and Ideas</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Give every employee the opportunity to leave feedback, ask questions, and offer suggestions through a dedicated platform.</li>
                    <li>Foster a culture of “I can say anything”—even if it’s submitted in written form.</li>
                    <li>Provide flexibility by allowing feedback to be either anonymous or open, depending on the employee’s preference.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Just as on social media, where people can post comments
                    and view others’ opinions, a similar system can exist
                    within a company. Public and shared communication
                    (except when privacy is requested) encourages
                    transparency and alignment with organizational values.
                    The option of anonymity is especially valuable—it allows
                    people to open up at their own pace, overcoming
                    hesitation or fear of hierarchy.     
                </p>
                <p>
                    A designated representative of the organization can
                    respond to employee input directly, or use AI-generated
                    responses crafted according to the company’s tone,
                    norms, and standards.     
                </p>
                <p>
                    It’s important not to fear the consequences of creating a
                    space for open culture and freedom of speech within the
                    company. Employees won’t “take over the world”—
                    instead, leaders gain a broader view of what’s really
                    happening inside the organization, enabling smarter
                    development. 
                </p>
                <h2>Awareness as a Driver of Change</h2>
                <p>
                    Consider the film The Truman Show, in which the main
                    character unknowingly lives in a manufactured reality for
                    nearly 30 years. His transformation begins when he starts
                    to observe small inconsistencies—things that were always
                    there, but that he’s now ready to see. This awareness
                    ultimately leads to a major shift in his identity and
                    purpose.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you’ve already been working on transparency and
                    culture in your organization, a digital system will only
                    reinforce your efforts. It becomes a natural part of
                    continuous improvement and support. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, if there’s resistance to seeing what needs to
                    change, no system—no matter how accurate—can show
                    you what you refuse to acknowledge. It’s essential to
                    understand that responding to employee feedback is not
                    about agreeing with everything. Rather, it’s an
                    <i>opportunity to explain, educate, and help employees
                    understand the reasoning behind certain processes and

                <h3>Staff Support: eNPS</h3>
                <p>
                    eNPS (Employee Net Promoter Score) is an electronic
                    employee satisfaction survey with customizable
                    parameters tailored to your organization. It helps measure
                    satisfaction levels and gather feedback from managers,
                    teams, stores, and online departments.        
                </p>
                <p>
                    By integrating eNPS results into performance evaluations,
                    companies can enhance managerial effectiveness in this
                    key area.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The system maintains employee anonymity and security
                    while providing the organization with valuable analytics
                    on recurring requests, problem areas, and overall trends.
                    For employees, it’s a clear and direct communication
                    channel. For the company, it’s a layered, data-driven
                    method for assessing satisfaction and identifying areas for
                    improvement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Are there risks of randomness, subjectivity, or bias?
                    Potentially, yes. However, when applied over a
                    representative time period and supported by test rotations,
                    these risks are significantly reduced.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This approach gives employees a real sense of freedom
                    and transparency. It reinforces their ability to express
                    themselves and receive honest, constructive responses
                    aligned with company policy. It also sends a message: just
                    as the organization evaluates the employee’s performance,
                    the employee can also assess the quality of the work
                    environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And for many people, this system taps into the natural
                    human desire for recognition, influence, and significance
                    — topics that will be explored further in the upcoming
                    article on employee growth, promotion, and evaluation.

                <h3>Staff Support. Add a Depth of Field</h3>
                <p>
                    In romantic cinematography, filmmakers often use depth
                    of field to focus the viewer’s attention on the main
                    characters. When a couple is in love, the background
                    fades away, blurring everything except their faces—
                    highlighting that, at this moment, nothing else matters.
                    So what creates that same kind of emotional moment
                    between a company and its employees? When all the
                    noise fades away, and what remains is a sense of
                    connection, recognition, and value?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here are a few ways to add that “romance” to your internal culture:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Send automatic greetings to employees on their
                        birthdays, work anniversaries, or upon promotions. A
                        simple, timely message can go a long way.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Generate personalized content, such as themed memes,
                        fun facts, or internal news updates, that bring people
                        closer together through shared humor or curiosity.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Create interest clubs within the platform—spaces where
                        employees can share hobbies or learn from each other
                        outside formal tasks.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use gamification to introduce friendly competition:
                        point systems, bonus structures, or virtual rewards that
                        can be exchanged for real-life benefits.
                        Build a platform where employees want to spend time.
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        Think of a company app or portal that feels like scrolling
                        a social media feed—personalized, engaging, and full of
                        useful content.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                And finally, we come to the question of freedom of expression.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some of the world’s leading tech organizations have
                    invested in internal social platforms not just for
                    communication, but to foster dialogue—a space where
                    employees feel heard and empowered. This isn’t about
                    power; it’s about building culture through open
                    conversation.
                </p>
                <p><b>So—how does freedom of speech function in your organization?</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Do employees feel safe expressing their ideas and concerns?</li>
                    <li>Is there a clear channel for feedback and suggestions?</li>
                    <li>
                        Do people participate not just because they have to, but
                        because they’re genuinely interested in being part of
                        something meaningful?
                    </li>   
                </ul>
                <p><i>
                    When freedom of expression is real and supported by
                    systems, it doesn’t weaken the organization—it amplifies
                    its potential

                <p>
                    Why does an article on employee promotion and
                    development start with a discussion of accidents?
                </p>
                <p>
                    When it comes to accidents, many would likely prefer a
                    world where risks to life are minimized as much as
                    possible. If we explore how to eliminate road accidents,
                    the answer lies in reducing the human factor on the roads.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>Similarly, in organizational processes, one way to create a
                    productive, people-oriented, and values-driven employee
                    assessment and development system is by minimizing the
                    human factor.</i> This can be done by developing clear
                    performance criteria for the organization and relying on
                    digital systems to calculate and assess these criteria.<i>The
                    idea is to evaluate people based on their performance in
                    measurable categories, rather than relying on feelings or
                    emotions.</i>

                <p>
                    The “accidents” that occur in organizations often happen
                    when efficiency collides with the emotional human factor.

                    All living beings exhibit certain behavioral patterns.
                    When a person finds themselves in a specific
                    environment, they assess it and choose the most
                    appropriate strategy for interacting with it. Only when a
                    person tries something and likes it will they want to repeat
                    it. Touching one object might be painful, while touching
                    another could bring pleasure. People naturally position
                    themselves in places that give them access to food and
                    shelter, and through a system of rewards, they seek to
                    improve their lives. Humans have a wide range of such
                    “programs,” which is why they have survived and thrived
                    over time.

                    instructions and cannot deviate from them unless there is
                    an alternative program to execute. Will a system based on
                    programmed criteria feel sympathy or dislike toward an
                    employee who has achieved the highest or lowest
                    efficiency? No, because such a system does not possess

                    One manager may find it convenient to work with a
                    certain type of employee, and as a result, their decisions
                    might lean toward giving advantages in promotion and
                    assistance to the chosen individual. However, another
                    employee might be more effective for the organization,
                    even though they might not pass the filter of human biases
                    from the person making promotion decisions. The reasons
                    can vary—from the employee being idealistic and asking
                    uncomfortable questions to lack the “sparkle” that is
                    often needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Reflecting on life experiences, many might recall
                    observing romantic relationships, friendships, conflicts,
                    and dissatisfaction in the workplace. This is not only
                    observed at work but also in school or college. Some fall
                    in love, others argue, and people mature and grow, yet
                    feelings remain, as that’s how nature works. While it is
                    possible to regulate relationship issues with training on
                    rules and norms, we can never prevent people from being
                    human. People should not feel guilty for being human.
                    However, it is possible to ensure that the emotional factor
                    does not negatively impact the organization’s success and
                    talent.
