                    All living beings have certain behavior patterns. Only digital systems, artificial intelligence, and
                    robots with programs cannot deviate from their programs.

                <p>
                    Reflecting on my journey from a sales consultant to a Human Resources and Training Director, I
                    can say that often organizations, without realizing it or perceiving it as a benefit, sincerely
                    believe that by changing people, they are creating an effective environment for interaction that
                    meets the organization's needs. However, working on changing human nature and biological
                    intelligence is a complex and not always effective task, especially when resources are available
                    for this purpose. Reprogramming a program to a new or necessary development vector is
                    effective, simpler, and more natural than reprogramming living people. Most likely,
                    in your organization, there are mature and formed individuals with their own history, past,
                    associative memory, feelings, reactions, and perceptions shaped by evolution and personal
                    experience through family and society. It is especially easier to give up moralizing, teachings
                    about what is good and bad, and attempts to change people when you start to take an interest
                    in human physiology. In my experience, as well as that of my colleagues, trainers, HR
                    managers, and company owners, there have been or remain hobbies of reading best-selling
                    business literature on how to be a manager, how to manage people, how to act and build a
                    company culture in order to be as successful as the author's or speaker's organization. Such
                    books and trainings often provide ready-made solutions, but the data and circumstances of the
                    company often do not resemble yours, and there is also a lot of general information, personal
                    stories, and fantasies in this genre that do not reveal the basis, such as who the person and
                    employee is that I want to influence. Such stories also tell what the author wants to tell, often
                    with a subjective view. By focusing on the knowledge of physiology and biological intelligence,
                    you stop guessing and fantasizing, and understand and accept why a person behaves or
                    reacts in certain ways in certain situations, and what needs to be done for employees to accept
                    the company's rules of the game. I also want to note that it is not at all bad or good when an
                    organization or manager applies methods to develop their organization and management.
                    Having investments, commitments, and responsibilities, people act, often considering their
                    philosophy true and effective in order to achieve their goal.

                <b>If we cannot reprogram a person, what can we do to ensure that people interact within an efficient system necessary for the organization, while minimizing the negative impact of emotions?</b>
                <third-picture>The animation movie "Soul" (2020). Directed by Pete Docter</third-picture>
                <p>
                    One possible answer can be found through the character of 22 in the animated movie "Soul".
                    In this animated film, the narcissistic character 22 cannot be convinced by anyone that life on
                    Earth is beautiful. Not even the great figures of humanity, not even Mother Teresa... Nothing
                    influences 22, except for real experience. After 22's soul accidentally ends up on Earth and
                    begins to explore life, she comes to a personal understanding that she enjoys life on Earth, and
                    she changes her mind. No moralizing, no persuasion, no influential personalities could achieve
                    what reality did.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In summary, the basis of successful interaction between people in organizations and
                    businesses often lies in understanding the physiology of human behavior, abandoning
                    attempts to change people, and considering alternatives to implementing digital systems
                    that will create the same environment where people will work according to the
                    organization's efficiency rules in a pleasant and healthy environment for all employees.
                    For each organization and business, we suggest developing unique approaches and
                    strategies that take into account the characteristics and requests of that particular
                    business. Of course, it is necessary to consider commonly accepted principles and
                    methodologies, but to adapt them to the specific needs and goals of the company. For
                    example, it makes no sense to create a round or triangular television, but it is important
                    to pay attention to the quality of the image and the viewers. What emotions and actions
                    will the environment of your organization evoke in your employees?
                </p>
                <p>And this is by no means a call to abandon one in favor of the other. Training, informal communication, and words also have a right to exist. It's like a special effect that decorates the scene of the movie and makes it brighter, but the special effect is not the meaning or the plot that we suggest focusing on. People can attend lavish training sessions, enjoy a delicious lunch, get motivated by their manager's words, but then return to their workplaces where processes often work situationally, subjectively, and bureaucratically, and fluorescent and HID lighting in workplaces only exacerbates depression.</p>

                <b>Privilege - having an opinion. It is beneficial for people to see other points of view, rather than just confirming their own.</b>
                <p>In the previous article on digital culture, we examined the reasons why implementing platforms and applications, as well as using digital options, can be a beneficial solution for both the organization and its employees. As technologies advance, so do people, as evolution demonstrates, from caves to the point where we create new life forms.</p>
                <p>Company culture encompasses all aspects of work, starting from the choice of chairs for employees and including performance evaluation systems, training, compensation, and communication between employees and between the company and its employees. In this work, we will propose options that can be implemented to improve communication within the company and receive feedback from employees</p>
                <h2>Volume 1. Corporate Culture. Interaction.</h2>
                <p>Within the framework of supporting and transparency of corporate culture, there are several key strategies that contribute to improving interaction with employees.</p>
                <h3>STAFF SUPPORT. Feedback. Questions. Ideas.</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Allowing all employees to leave feedback and ask questions through a special system, creating the opportunity for everyone to express opinions and suggestions.</li>
                    <li>Supporting the idea of "I can say everything!", even if it is in written form.</li>
                    <li>Creating a system that provides anonymity or openness of questions and requests upon employee's request.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Just as in social media, where everyone writes and everyone can view comments and requests from others, a similar opportunity can be provided within the organization, except when the request is directed directly. This option also encourages employees to adhere to company norms and rules, and the ability to remain anonymous helps people gradually open up, as fears and following authorities can suppress the desire to express ideas and be open.</p>
                <p>A responsible representative of the organization can formulate answers to employees there and generated AI options for responses, based on the company's norms and standards.</p>
                <p>There is no need to fear or think that if you provide a resource of open culture and freedom of speech in the company, employees will "take over the world." It is an additional ability to see more within your organization and, possessing this information, to develop.</p>
                <p>For example, in the movie "The Truman Show," the main character lived according to a predetermined script for about 30 years and was a participant in the show. The realization of this came when he began to notice what was happening around him. Everything was the same as yesterday, but today he wants and is ready to see his reality. This leads to the evolving finale of his personality. If you have been working on culture and democracy in your organization, the system and AI will only confirm this, and working on improvements and support will become a natural process for you.</p>
                <p>If you do not have the desire to see things that can be developed, no matter how accurate a system is, it will not be able to show you what you do not want to see and realize. It is important to understand that responding to employees' requests is not about agreeing with everything, but also an opportunity to educate and help employees understand why certain processes and decisions happen in a certain way and why it is important.</p>
                <p><i>One of the reasons objections arise is a lack of information!</i></p>
                <second-picture>The movie "The Truman show" (1998). Directed by Peter Weir</second-picture>
                <h3>STUFF SUPPORT. eNPS</h3>
                <p>ENPS is an electronic satisfaction survey with individually customizable parameters for your organization. It helps determine the satisfaction levels and requests of managers, stores, online platforms, and teams.</p>
                <p>Additionally, incorporating ENPS results into the evaluation of responsible employees' performance can enhance the work of managers in this indicat</p>
                <p>The system, while maintaining the anonymity and security of employees' feedback, can provide you with analytics on problematic requests and their frequency. For the employee, this is transparent feedback, while for the organization, it is a layered systematic analysis of job satisfaction and requests.</p>
                <p>Could there be factors of randomness, subjectivity, or bias? It is possible, but the likelihood of this in a representative period and with the use of test rotations is minimized.</p>
                <p>
                    All of this gives employees a sense and resources of freedom, awareness of the opportunity for self-expression at work, and receiving objective and honest solutions to their requests that do not contradict the organization's policies. It also gives a sense that not only is the organization evaluating the employee based on specific job criteria, but the employee is also evaluating the  favorability of working conditions. It is also worth noting that, for human nature, this provides many with the desired feelings of influence and significance,

                <h3>STAFF SUPPORT. Add a little romance... SMS: "I remember you and appreciate you."</h3>
                <p>In romantic movies, depth of field is often used when shooting the main characters. This means that when a couple in love is in the frame, they are in focus, while everything else is blurred, losing focus. This visual technique enhances the portrayal of love and shows that nothing else matters except the object of affection.</p>
                <p>What can create such "romantic" moments in the relationship between a company and an employee? When everything else fades into the background except the joy of the present moment?</p>
                <p>Automatically send birthday greetings, promotions, and congratulations for years of service in the organization to employees.</p>
                <p>Automatically generate themed memes, news about the organization, interesting facts, and create interest clubs can always increase enthusiasm for work.</p>
                <p>Using gamification in a system with ratings and rewards, where employees can earn points, bonuses, and compete in a gaming format, and then use the earned credits and benefits to their advantage.</p>
                <p>Systematizing corporate culture with the help of AI can be implemented through an app that employees will want to access, like scrolling through an Instagram feed, because there will be interesting and important information for the employee.</p>
                <p>And at the end of this article, I remembered that Elon Musk, indeed, bought Twitter (name changed to "X"). Many were curious about why such large and technological companies are adding a social network. Many will say - for power, and there is something to it. However, Elon himself answers in interviews that this purchase was made for one purpose - the development of democracy and freedom of speech for humanity.</p>
                <p>Think about freedom of speech in your organization: how free are employees in their expressions, ideas, and suggestions? And as with Elon and the idea of freedom of speech, such resources undoubtedly provide greater influence, in the case of business - influence on the world of your organization.</p>
                <p>What is the freedom of speech in your organization like? How freely do employees express their thoughts, ideas, and suggestions? How does the culture inspire being a part of the organization not just because it's important, but because it's interesting?</p>
                <p>And, of course, just like in the case of Elon Musk and the idea of freedom of speech, such resources undoubtedly provide greater influence, in the case of business - <b>influence on the world of your organization.</b></p>

                <h2>Would you like you and your children to live in a world without road accidents?</h2>
                <p>Why does the article on employee promotion and development start with a discussion on accidents?</p>
                <p>When it comes to accidents, many would probably like to live in a world where risks to life are minimized as much as possible. If we explore how to eliminate road accidents, the answer lies in removing the human factor on the roads. More details on this can be found in the works of Jacque Fresco.</p>
                <p>Jacque Fresco also considered the concept of a world without corruption, wars, and where the government serves the people, following all norms and established rules. An ideal government could be a being without emotions, only following its programs.</p>
                <p>One of the auxiliary methods for creating a productive, people-oriented, and values-driven employee assessment and development system is to eliminate the human factor from such processes. This is achieved by developing individual performance criteria for the organization and trusting the system's digital calculation options. The idea is to evaluate people solely based on their results in selected categories that are measured by numbers, not by feelings and emotions.</p>
                <p>That very "accident" in the organization occurs when efficiency clashes with the emotional human factor.</p>
                <h2>What will a person say? What will the system say?</h2>
                <second-picture>The movie «Terminator 2:Judgment day (1991)». Directed by James Cameron</second-picture>
                <p>All living beings have certain behavior patterns. When a person finds themselves in a particular environment, they assess it and choose the necessary interaction strategy. Only if a person tries something and likes it, they will want to repeat it. Touched one object - painful, touched another - pleasant. People occupy advantageous positions for obtaining food and shelter, and through a reward system, they improve their lives. Humans have a wide range of such "programs", otherwise, they would have become extinct.</p>
                <p>Robots with programs cannot deviate from their programs unless there are other programmed variations. Will a system with programmed calculation criteria feel sympathy or dislike towards an employee who has achieved the highest or lowest efficiency? No, because this system does not have such feelings.</p>
                <p>One manager may find it convenient to work with a certain type of employees, and likely, their decisions will lean towards giving advantages in promotion and assistance to the chosen individual. However, at the same time, another employee may be more effective for the organization than for the manager. But due to human criteria, they may not pass the filter for the person making the promotion decisions. The reasons can vary - from the fact that the employee is idealistic and asks uncomfortable questions, to the fact that they do not have the "sparkle" that is needed.</p>
                <p>Reflecting on life experience, many may remember observing romantic relationships, friendships, animosity, and dissatisfaction in the workplace. Probably not only at work, but also in school or college, some fall in love, others argue, and people mature and grow, but feelings remain, as that is how nature works. It is possible, of course, to regulate relationship issues with training on rules and norms, however, we can never prevent people from being human. People should not feel guilty for being human. However, it is possible to ensure that the emotional factor does not negatively impact the organization's success and talent.</p>

                <h2>A digital system does not feel fatigue in calculations</h2>
                <p>If people have an assistant who takes on the systematization of processes, calculations, and analytics, what can we achieve:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Elimination of the emotional factor in decision-making regarding employee promotion and development, as the system displays leaders according to set criteria.</li>
                    <li>Continuous access to indicators that affect employee and company effectiveness.</li>
                    <li>Automatic and systematic calculation of indicators with detailed breakdown of each parameter, providing continuous feedback for employees.</li>
                    <li>Minimization of a culture of favoritism or bias, focusing on set indicators.</li>
                    <li>Structured employee development system through the study of information/practice/achievement of results and continuous support.</li>
                    <li>Inclusion of results and scores of employee e-learning in the assessment and development system.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The digital technology for employee development is like a "treasure map" with a clear path and a reward at the end.</p>
                <p>The more understandable the system and calculations are, the more motivated employees will be to follow these paths and contribute to the organization through their growth. It is possible that some may question the accuracy of the system, but only the numbers can show the effectiveness over a comparative period. What happened to the metrics after the system was implemented and what was it like before? That will be the answer.</p>
                <p>People are already fulfilling their roles with a digital partner on the team. There is no need to think about whom to promote among employees - your system has already calculated the ratings. There is no need to explain to a likable and pleasant colleague why they may not receive a bonus or promotion this month - the system will calculate all results and show the cause-and-effect relationship.</p>
