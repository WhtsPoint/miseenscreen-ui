                    "Reflecting on my journey from a sales consultant to an Human Resources and Training Director, I can say that often organizations, without realizing it or perceiving it as a benefit, sincerely believe that by changing people, they are creating an effective environment for interaction that meets the organization's needs. However, working on changing human nature and biological intelligence is a complex and not always effective task, especially when resources are available for this purpose. Reprogramming a program to a new or necessary development vector is much more effective, simpler, and more natural than reprogramming living people. Most likely, in your organization, there are mature and formed individuals with their own history, past, associative memory, feelings, reactions, and perceptions shaped by evolution and personal experience through family and society. It is especially easier to give up moralizing, teachings about what is good and bad, and attempts to change people when you start to take an interest in human physiology. In my experience, as well as that of my colleagues, trainers, HR managers, and company owners, there have been or remain hobbies of reading best-selling business literature on how to be a manager, how to manage people, how to act and build a company culture in order to be as successful as the author's or speaker's organization. Such books and trainings often provide ready-made solutions, but the data and circumstances of the company often do not resemble yours, and there is also a lot of general information, personal stories, and fantasies in this genre that do not reveal the basis, such as who the person and employee is that I want to influence. Such stories also tell what the author wants to tell, often with a subjective view. By focusing on the knowledge of physiology and biological intelligence, you stop guessing and fantasizing, and understand and accept why a person behaves or reacts in certain ways in certain situations, and what needs to be done for employees to accept the company's rules of the game. I also want to note that it is not at all bad or good when an organization or manager applies methods to develop their organization and management. Having investments, commitments, and responsibilities, people act, often considering their philosophy true and effective in order to achieve their goal.",
                    "Summarizing the idea above, the foundation of successful interaction between people in an organization and business often lies in understanding the psychology of human behavior. However, it is better to develop unique approaches and strategies that consider the specific characteristics and needs of a particular organization and business. It is important not to disregard established principles and methodologies but to adapt them to the specific requirements and goals of the company. For example, there is no point in creating a round or triangular television, but it is important to consider the picture quality being broadcast and who the viewers will be.",
                    "One possible answer can be found through the character 22 in the animated film \"Soul.\" In this animated movie, the narcissistic character 22 cannot be convinced by anyone that life on Earth is beautiful. Not even great personalities of humanity or Mother Teresa can change this character's opinion. Nothing influences 22 except real-life experience. When she accidentally ends up on Earth, she begins to realize that she likes life on Earth and changes her mind. Neither moralizing, nor persuasion, nor influential personalities achieved what the environment did.",
                    "And this is by no means a call to abandon one in favor of the other. Training, informal communication, and words also have a right to exist. It's like a special effect that decorates the scene of the movie and makes it brighter, but the special effect is not the meaning or the plot that we suggest focusing on. People can attend lavish training sessions, enjoy a delicious lunch, get motivated by their manager's words, but then return to their workplaces where processes often work situationally, subjectively, and bureaucratically, and fluorescent and HID lighting in workplaces only exacerbates depression."

                    "For example, in the movie \"The Truman Show,\" the main character lived according to a predetermined script for about 30 years and was a participant in the show. The realization of this came when he began to notice what was happening around him. Everything was the same as yesterday, but today he wants and is ready to see his reality. This leads to the evolving finale of his personality. If you have been working on culture and democracy in your organization, the system and AI will only confirm this, and working on improvements and support will become a natural process for you.",

It also gives a sense that not only is the organization evaluating the employee based on specific job criteria, but the employee is also evaluating the  favorability of working conditions. It is also worth noting that, for human nature, this provides many with the desired feelings of influence and significance,",
