          "\"I'm not a robot!\" - How often have you heard this statement during interactions with people?\nAnd often it continues like this: \"I'm not a robot, I can make mistakes!\" And it's true - humans\nare capable of making mistakes, feeling, loving, getting upset. However, it's important to\nunderstand that all these feelings are a result of the evolution and nature of biological\nintelligence, and how this can impact the work and success of your organization is also an\nimportant and interesting question. In this article, you will learn about the systematic building of\nrelationships between employees and the organization through support for employees and\nfreedom of speech in the company, about creating unified rules of the game in conditions of\nefficiency and healthy relationships, and how digital technologies can help with this",
          "Reflecting on my journey from a sales consultant to an Human Resources and Training Director, I can say that often organizations, without realizing it or perceiving it as a benefit, sincerely\nbelieve that by changing people, they are creating an effective environment for interaction that meets the organization's needs. However, working on changing human nature and biological intelligence is a complex and not always effective task, especially when resources are available\nfor this purpose. Reprogramming a program to a new or necessary development vector is\nmuch more effective, simpler, and more natural than reprogramming living people. Most likely,\nin your organization, there are mature and formed individuals with their own history, past,\nassociative memory, feelings, reactions, and perceptions shaped by evolution and personal experience through family and society. It is especially easier to give up moralizing, teachings about what is good and bad, and\nattempts to change people when you start to take an interest in human physiology. In my experience, as well as that of my colleagues, trainers, HR managers, and company owners,\nthere have been or remain hobbies of reading best-selling business literature on how to be a manager, how to manage people, how to act and build a company culture in order to be as\nsuccessful as the author's or speaker's organization. Such books and trainings often provide ready-made solutions, but the data and circumstances of the company often do not resemble yours, and there is also a lot of general information, personal stories, and fantasies in this genre that do not reveal the basis, such as who the person and employee is that I want to influence.\nSuch stories also tell what the author wants to tell, often with a subjective view. By focusing on the knowledge of physiology and biological intelligence, you stop guessing and fantasizing, and understand and accept why a person behaves or reacts in certain ways in certain situations, and what needs to be done for employees to accept the company's rules of the game. I also want to note that it is not at all bad or good when an organization or manager applies methods to develop their organization and management. Having investments, commitments, and responsibilities, people act, often considering their philosophy true and effective in order to achieve their goal.",
          "Summarizing the idea above, the foundation of successful interaction between people in an\norganization and business often lies in understanding the psychology of human behavior.\nHowever, it is better to develop unique approaches and strategies that consider the specific\ncharacteristics and needs of a particular organization and business. It is important not to\ndisregard established principles and methodologies but to adapt them to the specific\nrequirements and goals of the company. For example, there is no point in creating a round or\ntriangular television, but it is important to consider the picture quality being broadcast and who\nthe viewers will be.",
          "One possible answer can be found through the character 22 in the animated film \"Soul.\" In this\nanimated movie, the narcissistic character 22 cannot be convinced by anyone that life on Earth\nis beautiful. Not even great personalities of humanity or Mother Teresa can change this\ncharacter's opinion. Nothing influences 22 except real-life experience. When she accidentally\nends up on Earth, she begins to realize that she likes life on Earth and changes her mind.\nNeither moralizing, nor persuasion, nor influential personalities achieved what the environment\ndid.",
          "And this is by no means a call to abandon one in favor of the other. Training, informal\ncommunication, and words also have a right to exist. It's like a special effect that decorates the\nscene of the movie and makes it brighter, but the special effect is not the meaning or the plot\nthat we suggest focusing on. People can attend lavish training sessions, enjoy a delicious\nlunch, get motivated by their manager's words, but then return to their workplaces where\nprocesses often work situationally, subjectively, and bureaucratically, and fluorescent and HID\nlighting in workplaces only exacerbates depression."
